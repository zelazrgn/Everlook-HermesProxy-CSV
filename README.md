# Everlook-HermesProxy-CSV

HermesProxy (https://github.com/WowLegacyCore/HermesProxy) CSV folder for the current Everlook patch

Either clone this project into your HermesProxy Folder, delete the existing CSV folder and rename Everlook-HermesProxy-CSV to CSV (and you can keep it updated using git pull)

Or download the latest release (https://github.com/zelazrgn/Everlook-HermesProxy-CSV/releases) and also rename the folder.

This is still very early stages, I'm only changing what people report to me.
